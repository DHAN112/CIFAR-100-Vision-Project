# Image Classification with TensorFlow on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-100

This project, completed for the "21 Projects in 21 Days" program, explores image classification using different neural network architectures. We build, train, and evaluate models on both the simple Fashion-MNIST dataset and the more complex CIFAR-100 dataset.

## üìú Description
The goal was to compare the performance of a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a deeper CNN. This helps demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs for computer vision tasks and how model complexity impacts results on datasets of varying difficulty.

## üìä Datasets Used
* **Fashion-MNIST:** A dataset of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28) across 10 clothing categories.
* **CIFAR-100:** A dataset of 60,000 color images (32x32x3) across 100 object classes.

## üß† Models Implemented
1.  **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** A simple baseline model with fully connected layers.
2.  **Basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A standard CNN with two convolutional layers.
3.  **Deeper CNN:** A more complex model with additional convolutional layers, Batch Normalization, and Dropout for better performance and regularization.

## ‚ú® Key Results
* The CNN models significantly outperformed the ANN on both datasets, confirming their suitability for image data.
* The Deeper CNN model achieved the highest accuracy of **XX.X%** on the CIFAR-100 test set.
* The project highlights the trade-off between model complexity and performance, showing that more complex models are necessary for more challenging datasets like CIFAR-100.
